# Assessments: Evaluating Your Physical AI Proficiency

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the scope and requirements of each major assessment.
- Familiarize with the evaluation criteria and rubrics for successful completion.
- Recognize how assessments reinforce learning and contribute to the overall project goals.

## Introduction
Assessments in this module are designed not just to test your knowledge, but to provide practical experience in building and integrating complex robotic systems. Each assessment is a substantial project that mirrors real-world robotics development, requiring you to apply concepts learned across multiple weeks. They collectively prepare you for the final Capstone Project, demonstrating your ability to design, implement, and evaluate autonomous systems.

## Assessment Descriptions and Criteria

### 1. ROS 2 Package Development Project
-   **Description:** Develop a fully functional ROS 2 package for a specified robotic capability (e.g., a basic navigation system for a mobile robot, a simple manipulator controller). This project will require creating nodes, defining messages/services, and using the ROS 2 build system.
-   **Mapping to Weeks/Modules:** Primarily aligns with **Weeks 3–5 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)**, but also incorporates foundational concepts from **Weeks 1–2**.
-   **Rubric/Evaluation Criteria:**
    -   **Code Quality (30%):** Readability, adherence to ROS 2 coding standards, modularity, commenting, error handling.
    -   **Functionality (40%):** Does the package perform the specified robotic task correctly and robustly?
    -   **ROS 2 Best Practices (20%):** Proper use of nodes, topics, services, parameters, launch files.
    -   **Documentation (10%):** README file, package description, usage instructions.

### 2. Gazebo Simulation Implementation
-   **Description:** Implement a detailed robot simulation within Gazebo. This involves creating or modifying a URDF model, integrating it into a Gazebo world, and simulating various sensors (e.g., LiDAR, camera). You will be required to demonstrate the robot's ability to perceive its environment and execute basic movements within the simulated world.
-   **Mapping to Weeks/Modules:** Directly builds on **Weeks 6–7 (Robot Simulation with Gazebo)** and integrates knowledge from **Weeks 3–5 (URDF/Xacro)**.
-   **Rubric/Evaluation Criteria:**
    -   **Model Accuracy & Realism (30%):** Fidelity of URDF model, accurate sensor representation.
    -   **Simulation Setup (30%):** Correct Gazebo world configuration, proper ROS 2-Gazebo integration.
    -   **Perception & Movement (30%):** Successful simulation of sensor data, demonstration of basic robot navigation/manipulation.
    -   **Report/Explanation (10%):** Clear documentation of setup and demonstration.

### 3. Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline
-   **Description:** Develop a perception pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac Sim. This assessment focuses on leveraging Isaac Sim's capabilities for synthetic data generation and advanced sensor simulation to detect and localize objects within a complex scene. The output should be integrated with a ROS 2 topic.
-   **Mapping to Weeks/Modules:** Strongly connected to **Weeks 8–10 (NVIDIA Isaac Platform)** and utilizes skills from **Weeks 6–7 (Simulation)** and **Weeks 3–5 (ROS 2)**.
-   **Rubric/Evaluation Criteria:**
    -   **Isaac Sim Setup (35%):** Correct scene creation, sensor configuration, ROS 2 bridge usage.
    -   **Synthetic Data Generation (35%):** Quality and relevance of generated data for perception task.
    -   **ROS 2 Integration (20%):** Seamless data publishing/subscribing with ROS 2.
    -   **Analysis & Visualization (10%):** Ability to interpret and visualize the perception output.

### 4. Capstone Project: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI
-   **Description:** The ultimate assessment is the Capstone Project, where you will integrate all learned components to create a simulated humanoid robot capable of understanding natural language commands, planning actions, navigating an environment, perceiving objects, and performing basic manipulation tasks. This project requires an end-to-end demonstration of autonomous behavior.
-   **Mapping to Weeks/Modules:** Integrates ALL previous modules and skills, with a strong emphasis on **Weeks 11–12 (Humanoid Development)** and **Week 13 (Conversational Robotics)**.
-   **Rubric/Evaluation Criteria:**
    -   **End-to-End Functionality (40%):** Successful execution of complex tasks from voice command to physical action.
    -   **System Integration & Robustness (25%):** Seamless interaction between sub-systems, ability to handle minor perturbations.
    -   **Architectural Design (20%):** Clarity of system architecture, modularity, maintainability.
    -   **Innovation & Presentation (15%):** Novelty of approach, quality of demonstration and explanation.

## Summary
The assessment framework is designed to provide hands-on experience and measure your proficiency across the spectrum of Physical AI. From foundational ROS 2 development to advanced humanoid robotics with conversational AI, each project is a stepping stone to becoming a competent robotics engineer.

## Key Terms
-   **Assessment:** A formal evaluation of knowledge or skills.
-   **Rubric:** A scoring guide used to evaluate performance on a task.
