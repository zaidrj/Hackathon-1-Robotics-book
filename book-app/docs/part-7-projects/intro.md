# Module 7: Projects, Weekly Plan, and Assessments

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the overarching purpose of the projects module.
- Recognize the integral relationship between weekly activities and the final capstone project.
- Familiarize with how the weekly breakdown prepares for the comprehensive humanoid project.

## Introduction
Welcome to Module 7, the culmination and application phase of your journey into Physical AI. This module is designed to bring together all the theoretical knowledge and practical skills you've acquired throughout the previous modules. It emphasizes hands-on application, structured project work, and continuous assessment to solidify your understanding and build tangible robotics projects.

## Purpose of the Module
The primary purpose of this module is to transition you from a learner of individual concepts to a creator of integrated robotic systems. You will learn how to:
- Synthesize knowledge from different domains (perception, control, planning, HRI).
- Apply best practices in robotic software development using ROS 2.
- Utilize simulation tools like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for development and testing.
- Develop, integrate, and evaluate components of an autonomous humanoid robot.
- Understand the workflow of a real-world robotics project, from ideation to assessment.

## Relationship to the Capstone Project
This module is intrinsically linked to the Capstone Project, which serves as the ultimate test of your comprehensive understanding and practical abilities. Every weekly activity, mini-project, and assessment is designed as a building block towards the final Capstone. You will incrementally develop components and integrate them, ensuring that by the end of the course, you have a fully functional (simulated) autonomous humanoid system that addresses a real-world challenge. The Capstone Project is not a separate entity but the grand sum of your efforts throughout this module and the entire book.

## How Weekly Work Leads to the Final Humanoid Project
The journey to building an autonomous humanoid robot is broken down into manageable weekly objectives. Each week introduces new concepts and challenges that directly contribute to a specific part of the humanoid project. For instance:
- Early weeks focus on foundational elements like ROS 2 communication and basic robot control.
- Mid-weeks delve into perception, mapping, and navigation using simulation.
- Later weeks concentrate on advanced topics such as manipulation, human-robot interaction, and the integration of large language models.
By diligently completing the weekly tasks and mini-projects, you will progressively assemble the necessary software modules and gain the expertise required for the final, complex humanoid capstone. This iterative approach ensures a deep understanding and practical proficiency.

## Summary
Module 7 serves as the practical application hub, connecting theoretical learning with hands-on project development. It establishes a clear path to the Capstone Project through structured weekly activities and emphasizes the integration of various Physical AI components into a cohesive humanoid system.

## Key Terms

## Exercises or Project Prompts
1. Reflect on a complex robotics project you envision. Break it down into smaller, weekly-sized components.
2. Research current humanoid robot projects. Identify the key modules or subsystems they employ and consider how they might align with the topics covered in this book.
3. Discuss with a peer how an iterative, weekly project approach benefits learning in robotics compared to a single, large project at the end.
